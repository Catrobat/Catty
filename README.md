# Catty
Catty, also known as "Pocket Code for iOS", is an on-device visual programming system for iPhones. If you used an Apple device in the previous steps, this is exactly the app that enabled you to create your first small Catrobat game.


## Team Culture
We work as a team and expect everyone to follow the rules. In our daily work, we use the methods listed below to create high-quality code. We support each other but also anticipate newcomers to learn about our coding principles proactively:

- [Test-Driven Development](http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment)
- [Clean Code](https://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Clean-Code-V2.2.pdf)
- Jira Workflow
- Style Guide
- Code Reviews
- Pair Programming
- Biweekly Meetings (remote)
